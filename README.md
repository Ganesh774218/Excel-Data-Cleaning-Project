# Excel-Data-Cleaning-Project
This repository contains seven end-to-end Excel data cleaning projects showcasing my ability to transform raw, unstructured, and inconsistent datasets into clean, analysis-ready data. Each project demonstrates strong skills in Power Query, Advanced Excel, Data Quality Improvement, and ETL workflows used in analytics and business reporting.

**Project Overview**

Data cleaning is one of the most essential steps in the data lifecycle.
In this repository, each file demonstrates a complete cleaning cycle including:
Removal of duplicates
Fixing inconsistent data types
Handling missing values
Splitting/merging columns
Applying transformation logic
Standardizing formats
Cleaning textual inconsistencies
Using Power Query M-code
Building repeatable ETL pipelines
Improving data integrity for reporting
These files represent practical business scenarios across domains like sales, HR, finance, operations, and inventory.
